<h1> Kipland Kinkel</h1>
<h3>The most remorseful killer?</h3>

    <p> Kipland Philip "Kip" Kinkel is a spree killer and school shooter who on May 20, 1998, murdered his parents, and then committed a school shooting at his former school, Thurston High, killing two students and wounding twenty-five others.

The shooting at Thurston High was considered the deadliest shooting at an American high school until the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School massacre and later the February 14, 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting (which currently remains the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history).

<p><em>Very informational video about Kip</em></p>
<h3>Backround</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a chronological table of events, here's a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kinkel/kip/cron.html"> timeline of his life</a>.</p>
<p> Kip's Backround is very interesting, due to his early developed schizophrenia which led to the murders he commited, and his family life, which seemed to have played a big role in his actions aswell. I certainly recommend, watching the video above or looking into a timeline of events since it is what makes this case stand out so much. The Thurston High School shooting weas also one of the first school shootings, before just some time later, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre">Columbine High School Massacre</a> happened.</p>

<h1>Adam Lanza</h1>
<p>He is probably the most discussed mass murderer along the TCC.Adam Peter Lanza was an American spree killer, mass murderer, and school shooter who perpetrated the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which left 28 people dead (including Lanza himself) and two injured. </p>

<h3>Backround</h3>
   <p>Adam Lanza was born on April 22, 1992, to Peter and Nancy Lanza. The Lanza family was of Italian descent. His mother would often take him and his brother shooting, having never suspected Adam of being dangerous. Adam attended the school he would later end up shooting, but suffered extreme anxiety problems starting in middle school (something which is believed to have been a possible motive). One time his anxiety got so bad he had to be taken to the ER of the Danbury hospital. He was moved to St Rose of Lima in 2005, but only stayed there for eight weeks. He later attended Newton High School by the time he was in his early teens. He was described there as "intelligent, but nervous and fidgety", and earned a place in the honor roll in 2007. The anxiety only grew worse and worse until he only went to school sometimes, and was ultimately homeschooled by his mother. Despite this, he managed to earn a GED and even attended some classes at the Western Connecticut State University. He was later diagnosed with Sensory-Integration Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, and Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
  
<h1>JonBenet Ramsey</h1>
<h3>Did her Family kill her?</h3>
<p>In the early morning hours of December 26, 1996, John and Patsy Ramsey awoke to find their six-year-old daughter JonBenét Ramsey missing from her bed at their home in Boulder, Colorado. Patsy and John had woken up early to prepare for a trip, when Patsy discovered a ransom note on the stairs demanding $118,000 for their daughter’s safe return.

Despite the note’s warning not to involve police, Patsy immediately called them, as well as friends and family in order to aid in the search for JonBenét Ramsey. Police arrived at 5:55 AM and found no signs of forced entry, but did not search the basement, where her body would eventually be found.

During the autopsy it was discovered that JonBenét Ramsey had died from asphyxiation due to strangulation, in addition to a skull fracture. There were signs of sexual assault and some pineapple found in her stomach. The parents claimed, she went straight to bed the night before, although JonBenet appeared to have eaten pineapple.

There are three popular theories in the Ramsey case;
<ol>
  <li>the family theory</li>
  <li>the parents theory</li>
  <li>the brother theory</li>
</ol> The initial investigation focused heavily on the Ramsey family for many reasons. The police felt that the ransom note was staged as it was unusually long, written using a pen and paper from the Ramsey’s house, and demanded almost the exact amount of money that John had received as a bonus earlier that year. Additionally, the Ramseys were reluctant to cooperate with police, though they later said this was because they feared the police would not conduct a full investigation and target at them as easy suspects. However all three members of the immediate family were questioned by investigators and submitting handwriting samples to compare to the ransom letter. Both John and Burke were cleared of any suspicion of writing the note. Although much was made that Patsy could not be conclusively cleared by her handwriting sample, this analysis was not further supported by any other evidence.</p>

  <h1>Eric Harris and Dyland Klebold</h1>
  <h3>The Blueprint for every school shooting?</h3>
  
  <p>Eric David Harris and Dylan Bennet Klebold were a pair of school shooters, bombers, and mass murderers responsible for the April 20, 1999 Columbine High School Massacre in Columbine, Colorado, which killed thirteen people and wounded 21 others before ending with both of their suicides.</p>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5QG-I9Ced0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p>At 11:10 a.m. on April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold arrived at Columbine High in separate cars and armed two 20 pounds (ca. 9 kg) homemade propane bombs inside the cafeteria. Before Harris left his car, he ran into Brooks Brown. After they talked for a moment, Harris told Brown, "Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home." Brown promptly left the premises. Prior to the shooting, Harris and Klebold had placed a propane bomb ca. half a mile (ca. 800 m) from the school, presumably as a diversion. The bomb only partially detonated and caused a small fire that was put out by the fire department. The pair's plan was to detonate the propane bombs inside the school, causing everyone inside to flee through the main exits, and then open fire at them from vantage points as they came running out. When ambulances, police, the fire department and the press arrived on the scene, time bombs set up inside their cars would detonate to strike them as well. Klebold's car bomb detonated when the police tried to defuse it, but no one was hurt. As for the cafeteria bombs, they malfunctioned and failed to detonate in a fortunate circumstance.</p>
  <p>At 11:26 a.m., they entered the library, which contained a total of 56 hiding students and staff. Harris injured a school athlete, Evan Todd, and Klebold killed a special-education student before they both reloaded their guns. When Harris said "Let's go kill some cops", they both proceeded to have another shootout with Denver police, but no casualties were taken on either side. Then, Harris and Klebold killed nine more students and injured eleven in the deadliest part of their massacre. All the while, they taunted students, even using racial slurs, and screamed their rage. They left the library at 11:36 a.m. after seven minutes of killing students. Their movements through the school then seemed directionless, shooting into empty rooms. They once threatened students hiding in a restroom, but didn't go in. They even made eye contact with students through door windows, but did not enter any classrooms. They then entered the cafeteria in an attempt to detonate their bombs. Harris made his first suicide bit by firing his carbine at one of the bombs, but it failed to detonate. They walked around, taking sips from cups left by students. A Molotov cocktail thrown by Klebold managed to only partially detonate one of the bombs, causing a fire. They walked through the school, reentered the cafeteria and the kitchen, then made their way back to the library. After having a third, brief shootout with the police and lighting a Molotov cocktail on a table, Harris and Klebold turned their guns on themselves and committed suicide by shooting themselves in the head, ending the 49-minute-long rampage.</p>
  <p>The columbine shooting was one of the first school shootings in the US, and the deadliest shooting until the Parkland shooting. It inspired many other young boys to do the same for example:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Seung-Hui_Cho">Seung-Hui Cho</a>, the perpetrator of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 that killed 32 people, influenced by Harris and Klebold, with the former even naming them as "martyrs" in his personal journals and videos, and the latter even (apparently) attempting to copycat the massacre by equipping himself with similar attire and weapons.</li>
      <li> <a href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Adam_Lanza">Adam Lanza</a> was into school shootings such as the Columbine and the Northern Illinois University shootings</li>
      <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneman_Douglas_High_School_shooting">Nikolas Cruz</a>, the perpetrator of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre also showed signs of mental health problems and praised school shooters of the past.</li>
    </ul>
